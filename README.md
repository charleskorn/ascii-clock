# ascii-clock

The May Shokunin challenge:

> In this challenge you must draw an analogue clock face.
>
> - The time is supplied on stdin in the format hh:mm, followed by a single newline. Both hh and mm are padded with a leading 0 (zero) if they are less than 10.
> - The analogue clock face representing that time, subject to the following rules, should be written on stdout.
> - Each hour mark should be drawn with 'o' (Lower-case O).
> - The hour mark representing the hour given in the input should be drawn with an 'h'.
> - The hour mark representing the minute given in the input should be drawn with an 'm'.
> - If the hour and the minute both fall on the same mark, then you should draw it with an 'x'.
> - You should round down the minutes past the hour to the nearest 5 for the purposes of marking it on the clock (so 23 becomes 20, 39 becomes 35).
